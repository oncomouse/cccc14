On the 4th of December, 2013, a mysterious woman known only as Atrio descended into the maelstrom of snow and ice surrounding the isolated village of Iliamna, Alaska. A census-designated place of 109, Iliamna was suddenly an important hub in a global struggle, and Atrio was braving the elements to land at the packed gravel runway of Merrill Field in a single-engine chartered Cessna. According to the account of the action posted online later, the plane landed and the pilot informed Atrio that a 30-minute window existed before the plane and its passenger would be stranded for days in the middle of the Alaskan wilderness.

With snow bearing down, Atrio waited with increased agitation for her mobile phone's GPS to penetrate the caustic and stinging weather and sync with a satellite that may or may not be in range in the isolated northern wastes of America's "Last Frontier." With literally seconds remaining, Atrio finally managed to simulataneously acquire a GPS signal and the village's meager 2G cellular network. Thus connected to the rest of the globe, she hastily completed her work and jumped into the waiting plane. Despite her pilot's warning that they might not be able to safely take off, with the storm bearing down upon them, the small plane buffeted into the air and escaped back to Anchorage and back to civilization, Atrio's mission successfully completed.[1][2]

All of this may sound a bit like a spy novel, and I don't think that comparison is entirely off base. Was, you may ask, Atrio working for an oil company, seeking new ways to extract fossil fuels from the harsh North? A government agent, perhaps, setting up a piece of equipment to spy on Russia across the Bering Strait? Did any of this even actually happen, you might also ask?

That last question, following the classic virtual / actual divide with which many Americans approach virtual worlds is perhaps "kind of." Atrio, you see, is not the codename of a CIA spy or the handle of an agent of corporate espionage. Instead, she is a player in the increasingly popular alternate-reality game, Ingress, developed and maintained by the Google internal start-up, Niantic Labs. The game's backstory posits a global struggle between a conspiratorial Enlightened and a plucky Resistance. Like other ARGs, however, the game is played as a hybrid between mobile devices and the physical world.

In the specific model of Ingress, players compete to form triangles between Portals, which positioned around the globe often at points of interest such as memorials and public artwork. In order to capture these portals, though, a player must phsyically interact with the virtual game space by means of uploaded GPS coordinates. And this need is what led to Atrio's daring action in Iliamna. By capturing the point for the Enlightened, Atrio not only secured that Portal but was able to capture much of the Western coast of the US, completing a triangle that encompassed all of California. Given the difficulty of accessing this specific portal, this capture marked a stunning coup for players of the Enlightened faction.

I tell this story as an introduction to my talk today, because, besides being a totally awesome example of what William Gibson has termed as the Internet "extruding," I think it highlights a fascinating nexus of narrative writing, surveillance, and multimodal composition.[2][3] I am interested in GPS-driven systems such as Ingress because they highlight a new and exciting emergent spatial writing that disrupts the widely-held view that space supplements but does not supplant writing. Ingress, by gamifying the act of being tracked using your GPS, also dramatizes the tensions surrounding cellphone-based surveillance recently exposed by John Snowden. As I'll be addressing in the remainder of my talk today, I am interested in the ways in which surveillance and tracking can be converted into the raw materials of a valorizing narrative. More specifically, I am interested in thinking through how this might inform the genre of personal narrative within the composition classroom.
